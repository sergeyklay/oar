## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report security vulnerabilities privately. Don't use public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

Send an email to oss@serghei.pl with:

- Issue type (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- Affected source files and their paths
- Code location (commit hash, branch, or URL)
- Steps to reproduce
- Configuration needed to trigger the issue
- Proof-of-concept code (if available)
- Impact assessment and potential exploitation scenarios

I'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide an update on the investigation timeline.

## Disclosure Policy

After confirming a vulnerability, I'll:

1. Fix the issue in a private branch
2. Test the fix thoroughly
3. Release a security update with a clear changelog
4. Disclose details after users have had time to update (typically 7-14 days)

Critical vulnerabilities receive immediate attention. Lower-severity issues follow the standard release cycle.
