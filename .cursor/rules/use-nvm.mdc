# Environment & Runtime Constraints

## Core Rule

**CRITICAL:** This project requires Node.js defined in the `.nvmrc` file.

The system environment might default to an older version. You MUST ensure the correct version is active before running commands.

## Terminal Command Execution Rules

**Context:** You are running in an interactive VS Code terminal. The environment is likely already loaded. If not, you must load it using `nvm use` once. You should never need to run `nvm use` more than once.

**Rule:** DO NOT blindly chain `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh` or `export` commands. It creates messy, fragile commands.


## Quick Reference

```bash
# ✅ DO: Correct nvm usage
nvm use

# ✅ DO: Check version if unsure
node -v
```
